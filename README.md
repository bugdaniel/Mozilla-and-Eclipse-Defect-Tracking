# Mozilla-and-Eclipse-Defect-Tracking

This project was part of a seminar on Business Analytics in the fall semester 2015 at the University of Zurich instructed by [Prof. Harry Paarsch](https://sites.google.com/site/hjpaarsch/). The work was done in collaboration with *Luca Gageauf*. The folder contains the following files:

- Read.py : a file written in Python importing and cleaning the data
- ExploratoryRead.py and ExploratoryLogit.R : files written respectively in Python and R which explores the structure of the data
- PredBugFixes.R : a file written in R in which we tested the best predictive models based on our exploratory analysis
